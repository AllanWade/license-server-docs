# Dynamsoft-hosting license tracking

> This article is about Dynamsoft-Hosting License Tracking, if you would rather track license usage yourself, please see [Self-hosting License Tracking]({{site.selfhosting}}index.html).

> If you have not purchased any Dynamsoft SDK license that requires usage tracking, please see [how to purchase a license]({{site.about}}purchase.html).

The following assumes you have purchased a trackable license and have chosen "Dynamsoft-Hosting" on the "Activate License" page in the [customer portal](https://officecn.dynamsoft.com:808/customer/license/fullLicense).

## Activate the License

On the "Activate License" page, set an Alias for your license or leave the default Alias and click the "Activate" button.

> Read more on [What is an Alias]({{site.about}}terms.html#alias)

Once the activation is done, the next step is to [Configure the license](#configure-the-license).

## Configure the License

To configure the license is to manage the Handshake Codes for the license. For more details, please see [how to manage the handshake code]({{site.common}}handshakeCodes.html).

> Read more on [What is a Handshake Code]({{site.about}}terms.html#handshake-code)

## Track the License

For Dynamsoft-Hosting License Tracking, all usage data is submitted to the [ `LTS` ]({{site.about}}terms.html#license-tracking-service) hosted by Dynamsoft. You can
