# Manage the Handshake Codes for your licenses

> Read more on [What is a Handshake Code]({{site.about}}terms.html#handshake-code).

Dynamsoft trackable licenses are consumed through Handshake codes. On this Handshake Codes page, you can

* View existing handshake codes
* Add new handshake codes
* Edit current handshake codes
* View the statistcs of a handshake code
* Change license usage order for handshake codes which are configured with multiple license items

We'll dive deeper into these topics below.

## Existing Handshake Codes

For Dynamsoft-Hosting License Tracking, a Handshake Code is generated by default for each activated License which may contain one or multiple License Items.

For Self-Hosting License Tracking, `LTS` generates a default Handshake Code for each imported License File which essentially contains a License that may contain one or multiple License Items.

After that, you can [add more Handshake Codes](#add-a-handshake-code) or [edit the existing Handshake Codes](#edit-a-handshake-code). For a Handshake Code that points to multiple License Items, you can also [Change License Usage Order](#change-license-usage-order).

> NOTE
>  
> Although default Handshake Codes are generated on a per purchase order basis, the Handshake Code itself has nothing to do with the purchase order. Instead, it is only related to the License Items configured to it, and these items can be from any order.

## Change License Usage Order

If multiple License Items are configured to one Handshake Code, the question of which License Item is used first will arise. Dynamsoft License Tracking Server has a default order which follows these rules

* The one with the closest expiration date is consumed first
* The one containing the most specific permit gets consumed first
* The one containing the least restrictive permit will be consumed first

With the default order, the Handshake Code should be able to take full advantage of the License Items. However, you can also click on the button "Change License Usage Order" and rearrange the usage order.

## Show Statistics

Usage statistics are summarized per Handshake Code. You can click the "Statistics" button for a Handshake Code to view the statistics for it. 

A few things to note are

* If a Handshake Code points to multiple License Items, these items will show up at the top of the statistics page with respective status
* The charts on the page are meant for the Handshake Code, adding and removing License Items from the Handshake Code will not affect the historical figures

## Add a Handshake Code

When you add a Handshake Code, you can configure it in a few ways

* Assign a string as the name of the Handshake Code. 

  The name of a Handshake Code consists of two parts

  {Dynamsoft ID} - {custom string}

  The first part must be your Dynamsoft ID. The second part can be any valid string. For example

  + 216998-100025900
  + 216998-vehicleCode

* Set one or multiple validation field(s).

* Set a Session Password

> Read more on [What is a Session Password]({{site.about}}terms.html#session-password)

* Configure License Items for the Handshake Code

  All activated License Items will show up on the page, you can choose one or multiple items and add it to the Handshake Code.

## Edit a Handshake Code

You can edit any existing Handshake Code, the things you can change are exactly the same as when you [add a Handshake Code](#add-a-handshake-code).

> For Dynamsoft-Hosting License Tracking, the default names for the auto-generated Handshake Codes can not be changed.

## Use a Handshake Code

A Handshake Code can authorize a client device either via the Dynamsoft-hosting `LTS` or a Self-hosting `LTS` .

Dynamsoft-hosting `LTS` servers are built into Dynamsoft SDKs and don't need to be set.

For Self-hosting `LTS` , you need to set the `LTS` servers manually. See [How to Configure LTS]({{site.common}}mechanism.html#configure-lts) for more information.
