# Dynamsoft Barcode Reader Licensing FAQ

## Can a client device work offline?

For the Per Device licensing option, yes, however a device must go online to complete the device registration for the first time of using the barcode scanning feature. Afterward, the barcode scanner can work completely offline for a maximum of 7 days.

## For an environment with no internet connection allowed, can I use your barcode reader SDK?

Yes. For enterprise customers who do not allow any internet connection to the public network, we offer a few flexible options. Please contact [support@dynamsoft.com](mailto:support@dynamsoft.com) for details.

## How secure is the license verification mechanism?

As a standard process, our barcode library automatically generates a unique ID (based on the hardware information collected from the current device). For security, the ID is hashed via the irreversible SHA algorithm before sending to the license server for registration. As the generated output ciphertext cannot be converted back to the input text (i.e., the original ID), the hardware info of the device is very well protected.

## Can a device be uncounted from my runtime license if it is no longer in use?

By default, the registered device list on the license server is automatically refreshed once per year. After refreshing the list, inactive devices do not take up your license allowance anymore.

However, if you are in a business with a high turnover rate of your devices/users, you can contact your account manager to refresh your device allowance every three or six months. Please note that an additional fee is required for the special configuration to your Dynamsoft account.

## Can I upgrade my current runtime license key to support more devices at any time?

Yes. You can contact [sales@dynamsoft.com](mailto:sales@dynamsoft.com) to expand the volume of your current handshake code.

Rest assured that your handshake code remains unchanged during the upgrade process, so no code change is required to your application.

## How do I increase my barcode scan quota?

To increase the quota of your license, please send your request along with your current key to  [sales@dynamsoft.com](mailto:sales@dynamsoft.com). For your convenience, your handshake code will remain unchanged after the extension.

## How can I renew my runtime license key before its current expiration date?

You can log into the customer portal to renew your runtime license by credit card or PayPal. Or, you can contact [sales@dynamsoft.com](mailto:sales@dynamsoft.com) if you prefer other payment methods (wire transfer or check).

Rest assured that your handshake code remains unchanged during the upgrade process, so no code change is required to your application.

## Can I purchase a runtime license key valid for more than one year?

Yes. Please contact [sales@dynamsoft.com](mailto:sales@dynamsoft.com) with your request.

## Will the unused credits be rolled over to the next period?

No.

## Can I filter unwanted barcodes to reduce the consumption of my license?

Yes. There are many pre-scanning settings you can apply to your barcode scanner.

For example, you can specify barcode format, limit the scanning to predefined regions or return only high-confidence values. For more settings, please refer to  [this page](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/parameters/scenario-settings/decode-result.html).
