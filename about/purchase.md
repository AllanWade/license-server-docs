# Purchase a License

## How to purchase

The Licenses to use Dynamsoft Products can be purchased in a few ways

* Purchase on the Dynamsoft Store
  + [Purchase Dynamic Web TWAIN](https://www.dynamsoft.com/store/dynamic-web-twain/)
  + [Purchase Dynamsoft Barcode Reader](https://www.dynamsoft.com/store/dynamsoft-barcode-reader/)

> This option is the easiest and provides you with the license in minutes.

* Purchase via a Purchase Order

> This usually means sending a digital copy of the order to [Dynamsoft Sales Team](mailto:sales@dynamsoft.com). Since the order is processed manually, this option usually takes one business day.

* Purchase via a Reseller

> Dynamsoft has many resellers around the world, you can buy from one that is most convenient for you. Find the reseller list [here](https://www.dynamsoft.com/Partner/Resellers.aspx).

## Check the purchased items

All purchased items are registered to the Dynamsoft account associated with your organization. You can check your purchases in the customer portal once you log in with your account.

If you already have a Dynamsoft account and you used the same email to make the purchase, you can [log in](https://www.dynamsoft.com/api-common/Login/Login) and [check the purchase orders](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/order/list).

If you don't have an existing Dynamsoft account or you used an unregistered email to make the purchase, a new Dynamsoft account will be automatically created with that email. In this case, you must first use the [Forgot Password?](https://www.dynamsoft.com/api-common/Regist/ForgotPassword) link and use the same email to set a password before logging in.

> You can also [register](https://www.dynamsoft.com/api-common/Regist/Regist) before making a purchase.

After logging in, if you don't land on the "Licenses" page, you can get there by clicking *Customer Portal -> License -> Full License*.

At this moment, the license(s) is not yet activated. Read on to learn [how to activate the license]({{site.about}}activate.html).

## License Restrictions

There are two restrictions for each trackable license

* Time

By default, a license is good for a year once activated. Before a license expires, you can renew it.

* Quota

<!--TODO add quota should be doable by customer-->
A license comes with a fixed quota. If the quota is used up before the license expires or you find that quota cannot handle the application traffic, you can add extra quota by contacting the [Dynamsoft Sales Team](mailto:sales@dynamsoft.com).

### Renew a license

Renewing a license provides you with a license that has the same quota but is good for another year starting from the day the old license expires.

### Add quota

Adding quota adds a new license with a specified quota, then the new license is configured to the same [Handshake Code]({{site.about}}terms.md#handshake-code).
