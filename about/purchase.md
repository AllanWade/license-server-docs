# Purchase a License

## How to purchase

The Licenses to use Dynamsoft Products can be purchased in a few ways

* Purchase on the Dynamsoft Store
  + [Purchase Dynamic Web TWAIN](https://www.dynamsoft.com/store/dynamic-web-twain/)
  + [Purchase Dynamsoft Barcode Reader](https://www.dynamsoft.com/store/dynamsoft-barcode-reader/)

> This option is the easiest, you get the license within minutes.

* Purchase via a Purchase Order

> This usually means sending a digital copy of the order to [Dynamsoft Sales Team](mailto:sales@dynamsoft.com). Since the order is processed manually, this option usually takes one business day.

* Purchase via a Reseller

> Dynamsoft has many resellers around the world, you can buy from one that is most convenient for you. Find the reseller list [here](https://www.dynamsoft.com/Partner/Resellers.aspx).

## Check the purchased items

Each purchased item is registered to a specific Dynamsoft account associated with your organization. You can check your purchases in the customer portal once you log in with your account.

If you already have a Dynamsoft account and you used the same email to make the purchase, you can [log in](https://www.dynamsoft.com/api-common/Login/Login) and check the purchased items.

If you don't have a Dynamsoft account or you used an unregistered email to make the purchase, a new Dynamsoft account will be automatically created with that email. In this case, you must first click [Forgot Password?](https://www.dynamsoft.com/api-common/Regist/ForgotPassword) and use the same email to set a password before logging in.

> You can also [register](https://www.dynamsoft.com/api-common/Regist/Regist) before making a purchase.

After logging in, if you don't land on the "Licenses" page, you can get there by clicking *Customer Portal -> License -> Full License*.

At this moment, the license(s) is not yet activated. Read on to learn [how to activate the license]({{site.about}}activate.html).

## License Restrictions

There are two restrictions for each trackable license

* Time

By default, a license is good for a year once activated. Before a license expires, you can renew it.

* Quota

A license comes with a fixed quota. If the quota is used up before the license expires, you can add extra quota.

### Renew a license

To renew a license is to add a new license that has the same quota but is good for another year starting from the day the old license expires.

### Add quota

To add quota is to add a new license with a specified quota, then configure the new license to the same Handshake Code.
