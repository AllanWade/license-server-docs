# About the docs

These docs aim to help you learn and understand how Dynamsoft License Tracking works. 

## Purchase licenses

If you are interested in acquiring a trackable license to use one of Dynamsoft's SDKs, please see page [Purchase a License]({{site.about}}purchase.html).

## Types of trackable licenses

Not all Dynamsoft Licenses are trackable, we say that a trackable license is one that is compliant with [Dynamsoft License 2.0]({{site.about}}terms.html#license-2.0). To learn more, please see page [Trackable Licenses]({{site.about}}licensetypes.html).

## Terms

To learn about the definitions of handshake codes, license items, and other terminologies, please see page [Terms]({{site.about}}terms.html).

## Activate trackable licenses

Activation is required for trackable licenses to work. Please see [How to Activate a license]({{site.about}}activate.html).
